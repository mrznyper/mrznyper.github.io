        <h1>Software Engineer | Student</h1>
 
		&emsp;In the summer of 2016, I was an Application Developer intern for JPMorgan Chase. During my internship, I worked with an intern group to create an internal screen to visualize and attest to all firm-wide positions of a single product.
			I had the wonderful opportunity to meet frequently with business users and upper management to understand business need and gather requirements. My individual contributions focused on front-end design and development, and data acquisition and formatting.
			I optimized data queries to return only a few thousand entries instead of half a million, without loss of precision or accuracy in our application.

		<br>
        <br>
		&emsp;Previously, I was also an undergraduate researcher and developer for the <a href="https://www.rfcuny.org/RFWebsite/">CUNY Research Foundation</a>. 
				My research was focused on the statistical analysis and visualization of non-Euclidean treespace. The majority of my work adapted <a target="_blank" href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/owen/">Megan Owen’s</a> previous work into a standalone, cross platform software package. From the very beginning, I designed the program’s behaviour, flow, and appearance to make her codebase much more accessible. My goal was facilitate applications of the program in biomedical imaging and evolutionary biology.
				Before that, I had also studied computational complexity theory and its applications with Professor <a target="_blank" href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/mjohnson/">Matthew P. Johnson</a> at the CUNY Graduate Center.
		<br>
        <br>
		&emsp;Past education includes Fox Lane High School from which I graduated with Honors in the Spring of 2013.
        At Fox Lane I used my programming ability to lead the school's Robotics Club, and create a Computer Science Club.
        <blockquote>
		<br>In the Robotic's club I lead multiple teams and was elected Vice President. Memorable moments in the club are when we competed in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalroboticschallenge.org/joomla/">National Robotics Challenge</a>. I personally took part in the Mazebot, and Mini Sumo events, and assisted the Heavy Weight Sumo team.
        <br>
		<br>In the Computer Science Club I acted as Vice President and then President. Notable achievement of the new club was the development of Fox Lane's <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flhs-info/id656392819?ls=1&mt=8">first official app</a>.

       &emsp;Though programming is my passion, I've recently taken up Graphic Design as a hobby. As a non-artist, graphic design is the perfect mix between the functionality of code and the aesthetics of art. Careful attention to content layout, proper typography, and pleasing color palettes has allowed me to improve my web design. 
        <br>
        <br>
        &emsp;Another interest of mine is Languages. My native tongue is Spanish, and English is my Second language. Nonetheless, I'm fluent in both. My third language, French, I studied for 6 years. I have recently begun learning Japanese which will be my Fourth language.
