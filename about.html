        <h1>Student | Programmer | Researcher</h1>
        &emsp;I'm Marlon Figueroa. I'm a programmer currently residing in Westchester, New York. Though mostly self taught, I have been avidly programming for a few years.
        <br>
        <br>
        &emsp;I'm currently formalizing my studies by majoring in Computer Science at Lehman College as a member of their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lehman.edu/undergraduate-bulletin/thelehmanscholarsprogram_0.htm">Scholars Program</a>. 
				In addition to being a student, I'm also an undergraduate researcher at Lehman. I'm currently researching computational complexity theory and its applications alongside <a target="_blank" href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/mjohnson/">Professor Matthew P. Johnson</a>
		<br>
        <br>
		&emsp;Previous education includes Fox Lane High School from which I graduated with honors in the Spring of 2013.
        At Fox Lane I used my programming ability to lead the school's Robotics Club and created a Computer Science Club:
        <blockquote>
		<br>In the Robotic's club I lead multiple teams for many years and was elected Vice President. Memorable moments in the club are when we competed in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalroboticschallenge.org/joomla/">National Robotics Challenge</a>. I personally took part in the Mazebot, and Mini Sumo events, and assisted the heavy weight Sumo team.
        <br>
		<br>In the Computer Science Club I acted as Vice President and then President. Notable achievement of the new club was the development of Fox Lane's <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flhs-info/id656392819?ls=1&mt=8">first official app</a>.
		</blockquote>
        <br>
       &emsp;Though programming is my passion, I've recently taken up Graphic Design as a hobby. As a non-artist, graphic design is the perfect mix between the functionality of code and the aesthetics of art. Careful attention to content layout, proper typography, and pleasing color palettes has allowed me to improve my web design. 
	   <!--Examples of some of my web design work can be found at my <a target="_blank" href="links.html">Links</a> page.-->
        <br>
        <br>
        &emsp;Another interest of mine is Languages. My native tongue is Spanish, and English is my Second language. Nonetheless, I'm fluent in both. My third language, French, I studied for 6 years. I have recently begun learning Japanese which will be my Fourth language.

        &emsp;Of course, this doesn't cover everything about me. If your interested in getting a much more complete list of my past feats click over to my <a href="resume.html">Resume</a>.

        <br>
        &emsp;Overall, I'm don't have much "real world" experience. I am, after all, still a student. However, I'm passionate about programming, keen on design and eager to learn!
